# Snow10

Obfuscate &amp; Encrypt Text as White-Space

This is the Android app version. See the main repo is at [/beardog108/snow10/](https://github.com/beardog108/Snow10)

# Sharing

This app will be available as PAID on Google Play, however it will remain free + open source under the GPLv3 license (via this Github repo). While the LICENSE file dictates the terms of sharing, I would strongly appreciate that any other copies uploaded to 'app stores' be under a name other than Snow10, and preferably have non-trivial changes.

Sharing & forking under the original name outside 'app stores' is fine.

# Warnings

* No steganography is perfect, your message may be discovered especially by skilled adversaries.
* Some text editors (like vim) show zero width characters
* Some clients/places may strip whitespace characters
* Use encryption if you really need to protect your messages. Use a good password but keep in mind that no encryption is perfect (Snow2 uses cryptojs AES)
