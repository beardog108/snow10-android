# Warnings

* No steganography is perfect, your message may be discovered especially by skilled adversaries.
* Some text editors (like vim) show zero width characters
* Some clients/places may strip whitespace characters
* Use encryption if you really need to protect your messages. Use a good password but keep in mind that no encryption is perfect (Snow2 uses cryptojs AES)
